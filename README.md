# Own LAMP Server on Rocky Linux 8.10

## 1 Introduction
This Project aims to create a LAMP server out of a virtual disk image (VDI). This VDI has a configuration file for Virtual Machine (VM) box - native linux virtualization environment. 
I configured the Apache server to
handle browser requests, MariaDB database for storing website data, and PHP for
server side scripting of the Wordpress installation.
I configured the RAM, ROM, CPU, and network card (with RAM, ROM) 
on our laptop / personal machine. Once that boots, the OS itself will
have different RAM, CPU, and network Card.

## 2 Server
The Server has been uploaded on the Cloud. You can find it in the below link:
